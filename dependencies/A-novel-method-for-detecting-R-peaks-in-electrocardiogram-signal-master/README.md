## Author notes: 
	This paper maybe the first using shannon energy for QRS complex detection. 
	I have implemented matlab code for this algorithm. The performance is not as good as described in paper.
	If you find any error in the code, please let me know.
	The coding was done using Matlab 2018a.
	A main function for loading the MIT-BIH database is required.
	The performance on MIT-BIH Arrythmia Database:
